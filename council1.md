Food for the summer: for those who are interested in eating in the house, I can make a food budget and we all pay a small fee (weekly basis, etc.) access to CFS, but right now I can only get supplies. If Ipass a budget, I can get essentials.

If there are requests (appliances, food items, etc.) let me know, I can pretty much get whatterver added to the kitchen.

If there's a problem in the kitchen, lmk.

### Vivi - house manager

Hi, house, I'm viv. I'm running for house manager. I was hm in spring 25 and I really enjoyed it. I've been here since Fall 24 and I've been infatuated ever since. Last spring, I found it very rewarding to be involved in the community as house manager. I learned a lot, I feel a lot more experienced and equpped for the role. Specifically, how to prioritize. Addressing criticisms, most were about a semester I wasn't here, but they were about confidentiality and reporting, and I will absolutely respect conf. Only one position because so few people here.

#### anon comments

- It's been really easy and nice to work with Vivi. Nice change of pace. Graciousness of running alone and giving up extra funding to be reallocated. One house manager isn't unprecedented.

- Vivi has been a really good hm and I'm sure she'll continue to be.

- Ppl forget that hm is respons for low-levl conflict, but Vivi is one of the most easy and friendly people to talk to in the house. I think she will be great.

#### Q&A
q - Prior problems with confidentiality resurface, how would you prevent them from being a problem?

a - I'm req to report incidents to central office, puts me in a spot of liability, but I want to respect confidentialy.

q - Can we put the extra money into Buyers Club?

...

q - What's your fav color?

a - Yellow like CZ!

### Evan - already given speech and recieved anon comments

Added to ballot

### Ella and Tavi (Ella)

Ella and I are running as a team, first half this week, second next.

Responsibilities: organizing the health cabinet and passing the budget

I'm running because I wanted to make sure we had the basic necessities because that can be really great prevatantive. 

Another resp from the past that I would be willing to do would be workshops and 'zines.

Welcome questions.

#### annon comments

#### Q&A

## 1 - Bylaw ammendment

6.19.1.A “in summer 2025, there are up to 2 health managers receiving a cumulative 1 hour of workshift” submitted by Ella Mui Shonk 
Rationale: “tavi and I want to run together as health managers” 
Current Bylaw: “There is one health manager.” 

q - How will the hour work?
a - Tavi will decline the hour since Tavi is already getting 5

q - Is this permanent?
a - No, exception for this summer

q - Comment: uncomfortable with anyone doing something without compensation, bad precedent
a - We're doing this because we both want to.

q - Comment: as written, not explicitly saying that someone will not be compensated, but later notes in workshift saying that less than 1 hour increments will not be used
a - self-answer

q - Comment: same as just having no motion and just helping out
a - Truly, agreed, will see what Tavi thinks

q - Comment: I don't think someone should be working two positions, worried about burn out
a - If there's burnout, since there's two, that's something they could work out.

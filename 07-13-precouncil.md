## Motions

### Motion 8.1 - PNG

Motion to PNG Fionn Rowntree-Roberts submitted by … 

Rationale: This person has caused a czar to feel scared in the house.

### Motion 8.2 - Get-to-Know-You Night

Host around 25 people for a get-to-know-you night submitted by Ida 

### Motion 8.3 - Extended Guest Stay

Host Elery(human), Daniel(human), and Rocky(dog) for 2 weeks (July 11 - 25) submitted by Sai

### Motion 8.4 - Bylaw Amendment

(⅔ over 2 Councils)

Change the Bylaw Section 1.2.III from: 
“Members may not make excessive noise after 11pm during finals or on school nights; on other nights  begins at 1am. Excessive noise is defined as any noise that can be heard from a member’s room which causes a disturbance.” 

 “Quiet Hours are to be decided each semester during Fireside Chats and affirmed in that semester’s Community Agreements. Excessive noise is defined as any noise that can be heard from a member’s room which causes a disturbance.”  submitted by Cristian “CZ” Zamora 

Rationale: Quiet hours have long been dynamic, being set during the Fireside Chat/Community Agreement Process. This Amendment brings this Section of the Bylaws in alignment with current practice. I left the definition for excessive noise in there, but feel free to offer suggestions!

#### Comments

Should we keep the original wording as a suggested starting point? - Tavi

Response - We reference what has been done previously in fireside chats anyway. Not needed.

# Quincenera Debrief

Slow, but felt like an intimate gathering.

Went well, lots of new Czars present.

Melaph came out to the courtyard "yelling at people" at 1:30 a.m. (30 minutes after the party had been scheduled to end, 30 minutes before the start of official quiet hours as passed in July 9th council).

Many party attendees were disturbed by this, some were angered, but the incident ended peacably with speakers being moved inside the Red Room to minimize courtyard noise.

Some time after 2 a.m., Melaph came into the Red Room and "tried to rip cables out of the speakers" (the speakers seemed unaffected), before approaching Vivi.

At 2:48 a.m., Izzy sent a message to the house-general channel of the Discord asking people to respect noise levels. 

Around 3:30 a.m., a fire alarm was pulled on the 100s floor.

# Member announcements

Timothy - Red card: Give to police/ICE/etc. informs officials that they need a warrant and you reserve your rights

Leah - Friends had a run ins with laced drugs. We have fent test strips. Test your shit.

Ella - 200s bathroom has the strips.

Ella - The likelihood of being fined for setting off the fire alarm goes up with each instance. If they decide to fine, that also means they can bring police with them.

## Fire alarms

Thank you to everyone that evacuated. We can get fined if people do not evacuate. We can get fined if the fire alarm is pulled without cause.

Motion to PNG Fionn Rowntree-Roberts submitted by … 

He is my ex-boyfriend, situation has been going on for 10 months. He visits multiple times a week, goes to parties, been too scared to do anything until now. Always on the brink of a panic attack living here, I want to feel safe. He almost hit me with his car outside of CZ. I just want to ask for your support.

Rationale: This person has caused a czar to feel scared in the house.

## Motion 8.4 - Bylaw Amendment

(⅔ over 2 Councils, Tavi presiding as CZ submitted)

Change the Bylaw Section 1.2.III from:
“Members may not make excessive noise after 11pm during finals or on school nights; on other nights  begins at 1am. Excessive noise is defined as any noise that can be heard from a member’s room which causes a disturbance.”

 “Quiet Hours are to be decided each semester during Fireside Chats and affirmed in that semester’s Community Agreements. Excessive noise is defined as any noise that can be heard from a member’s room which causes a disturbance.”  submitted by Cristian “CZ” Zamora

Rationale: Quiet hours have long been dynamic, being set during the Fireside Chat/Community Agreement Process. This Amendment brings this Section of the Bylaws in alignment with current practice. I left the definition for excessive noise in there, but feel free to offer suggestions!

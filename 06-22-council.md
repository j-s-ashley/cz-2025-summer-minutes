# Warm fuzzies

Jordan's had a couple of shit days, David's been clutch.

CZ feels like Jordan has been here for like two semesters.

David is hype about talking metal with Sai.

# Latest vibe

"Fuck you to whoever takes pots and pans to their room to use as plates."

"Please clean your dishes well." Greasy cutting boards, dirty knives on the magnetic rack.

"We have paper towels again and life is good."

"Kitchen so shiny!" The new set up looks great.

"If you see someone cooking chickpea pasta, tell me" - Margaux's food got stolen from the pantry. Blue bag, had Margaux's name on it. *Czecretary edit: food was returned the following day. Good job, CZ!*

## 5.2 - Community Agreements

After a few Fireside Chats, this is the current list of community agreements we ended up on. However, a good portion of the house(~50%) has yet to attend/ give input. Do we pass these now and amend next weekend, or do we wait entirely until more input is given? submitted by Cristian(CZ) Zamora 

Rationale: The house needs guidelines on what we expect from living together! Comoonity Agreements Summer 2025

Rescinded. No need to waste council time voting on agreements that will likely be amended within a week.

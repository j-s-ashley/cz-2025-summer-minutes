# Nominations, Elections, and Installations

## Installations

Newly elected Emmett for HabCoord and Vivi for HM! Congrats!!

## Elections

### Summer 

#### Health - Ella and Tavi

Ella and I are running together, menstral and contraceptions, health/m-health workshops, first aid training if available this summer, or we would do solo and ask for reimbursed. CPR certification listings. Running jointly because we're both enthusiastic. Recognition is important, so having both of us listed is beneficial. Limits known, recognize concerns about burnout, but I can do this.

##### Anon comments

Dedication appreciated. It's useful to have more people looking for resources and health supplies. Central systems are more costly, so alternative avenues are awesome.

##### Q&A

Plans for organizing?

Yes. Drawers or individual containers rather than piles.

---

#### Secretary - Jordan

##### Anon comments

Jordan been doing good job so far. They’re good at knowing when to take notes and what to not put on the minutes. 
It’s cool to see someone w the perfect skillset for this job, and cool that they’re a new move in willing to step up in that way. I have a lot of memories of secretaries, i love the position and i love everyone who does it. 

##### Q&A

Favorite font is century gothic. You can make it a title font. I don’t know if it’s dyslexic friendly but i can check on that.

For supporting clubs: i was pres of a physics club. I will be secretary for them this following year. I was secretary and student gov rep for the philosophy club and ethics debate team for my community college. 

 
### Fall

# Manager Announcements

## Vivi - room bids

6 rooms reserved as singles for DSP accomodations. CFS will be consulted tomorrow in preparation for room bids.

Ninoa says 53 for fall, no more than 6 DSP.

## Tavi - Raina stuff

I went on a walkthrough of Roch/Fen, talked with facilities manager about what Roch/Fen need (they're a distaster). They aren't letting people mmove in early, despite a bunch of people asking. They're full, can't take anyone else. I'll talk to CZ people, low enough occupancy to make temporary housing available for their early move in requests. We can name the number of people, how long, number of spaces available, etc. "We have flexibility."

Vivi - It has to be after the room bids and there are early room for us (4-5) for the fall.

CZ - Earliest we can get back to Raina will be the 4th or 5th. 

Vivi - What would be the end date? 22nd of August? 

Tavi - I can't confirm off the top of my head, I can look, but we have the power to do what works for us. 

CZ - Apartment contract start date and house contract start date are the same?

CZ to email Raina about plan to accomodate early move ins. 

# Nominations, Installation, Elections

Ran as two separate elections for the purpose of elections. Vivi to facilitate for CZ's bid for House Manager for Fall.

# Motions

Competing Motions: House Expenditure - Afro House 

TLDR - Only give this to Czars or give it to anyone who wants to do the work?

Option 1: Donate up to $700 from the Hab Account to fund 30 hours of paid workshift($22/hr) to help reopen Afro House 

VS 

Option 2: Authorize up to 30 hours of paid workshift from CZâ€™s hab account(~$700) to go to CZars who help out during the Afro House Work Days
submitted by Tavi 

Rationale 1: This money will be available for coopers from all houses who show up to the work days, and should only be used if the working group's paid workshift funding is used up. We can, if we'd like, ask to prioritize paying czars with this money.

Rationale 2: This option would have the money go only to people who live at CZ, but means that there will be less available for other co-opers who want to help out.

POI: ~$24,000 in the Hab Account as of Summer 2025

Vivi - Will Emmett be at council to answer questions?

A - Not sure

Ella - 

A - The board keeps telling us to use budgets that already exist, but those budgets don't have anything that fits the purpose of those budgets. We're offering this $700 for paid workshift IF other sources fall through. So, even if this passes there's no guarantee the money will be used.

CZ - If you know how many people/how many hours have already been used..

A - We started with about $5200 and have $700 left for workshift, 8-12 people per day. The thought is one mroe weekend of workdays.

Tavi comment: I apologize that I didn't talk with Emmett about this before. It was rushed, and I should have consulted.

Ella - We've gotten turned down with paid cookshift opportunities similar to this. I'm concerned that this will be the same.

A - I don't think that will be a problem here.

# Final Thoughts

CZ - Next week is the last week to submit any motion that requires a two week vote. Last council will be 8-10.

VOCs - Victoria wants us to do 2, but I think the next one will be a little briefer with lax requirements for quorum.

Ava - From a member perspective, there are a couple managers that I would change my ratings for, but I also think less people will respond.

Ella - Is the spreadsheet that was shared is from this semester? The secretary name is wrong. Other than that, I can understand people being upset about the numbers.

*CZ tries to delete Ella from existence*

## Emergency Motion - Espresso machine and grinder

Grinder is $600 (on sale right now). The machine itself is $1800.

This should come out of appliances budget (started with about $14000 for the summer).

## Nyanza - Unboxing

Can I unbox the package from the old Czar? It's from "Alum".

Yeah!!

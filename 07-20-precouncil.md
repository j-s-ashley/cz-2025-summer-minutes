## Motion 9.1

2nd Week Vote: PNG (⅔ over 2 Councils): Motion to PNG Fionn Rowntree-Roberts submitted by ...

Rationale: This person has caused a czar to feel scared in the house. 

## Motion 9.2

2nd Week Vote: Bylaw Amendment (⅔ over 2 Councils): Change the Bylaw Section 1.2.III from: 
“Members may not make excessive noise after 11pm during finals or on school nights; on other nights  begins at 1am. Excessive noise is defined as any noise that can be heard from a member’s room which causes a disturbance.” 

“Quiet Hours are to be decided each semester during Fireside Chats and affirmed in that semester’s Community Agreements. Excessive noise is defined as any noise that can be heard from a member’s room which causes a disturbance.”  submitted by Cristian “CZ” Zamora 

Rationale: Quiet hours have long been dynamic, being set during the Fireside Chat/Community Agreement Process. This Amendment brings this Section of the Bylaws in alignment with current practice. I left the definition for excessive noise in there, but feel free to offer suggestions!

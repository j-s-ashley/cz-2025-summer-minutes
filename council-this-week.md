## Motion 9.1

2nd Week Vote: PNG (⅔ over 2 Councils): Motion to PNG Fionn Rowntree-Roberts submitted by ...

Rationale: This person has caused a czar to feel scared in the house. 

Diamond's statement:

I definitely feel like this situation has been blown out of poropotion. Microagressions ever since I met her. I've sat on this to make everyone comfortable. This has been confusing for everyone around us. Thought it ended on good terms. I understand the feelings of seeing your ex but I feel like emotions have been irrational and immature. Previously Fionn had only been allowed in my room. I would like to make a proposal to allow him in the house but only in my room, not to parties. I apologize to Cassandra for making her feel unsafe.

Melaph's statement:

I think everyone's instict is to vote yes, but Finn is Dime's best friend. Dime's room has become a room of friendship and love, if we PNG a person who's a part of that kind of community, we're making that. He's not here to talk about how you hit his car. To PNG someone without context, fair enough. I don't think anyone will listen to us, but I want to add that. 

Diamond: I don't want to add on house drama, but I don't want it to feel different in the house, I don't want anyone to feel differently toward us. 

Cass: I agree with that last statement. Don't take this business personally. I want to say that I don't necessarily hold any. With him being in your room, I put him on the ban list for the halloween party and he was still invited, so I spent my night having to see him get kicked out. I know that he would be okay if he's not allowed to come here. But I will not be okay if he's allowed to come here. 

Called by Jordan, seconded by Nyanza

10 yaes, 2 naes, 1 abstain

Motion passed (2/2)

CZ - Motion to unPNG works the same way. PNG list will go out on Tuesday, promise

Melaph - Question about PNG that is central conduct related. If there is ever a case where someone is PNGed from a house, that case will have to go to Central. Will that happen here? A - (CZ) I'll have to check policy but if that is required then yes.

Motion 9.2 - Bylaw Amendment

2nd Week Vote: Bylaw Amendment (⅔ over 2 Councils): Change the Bylaw Section 1.2.III from: 
“Members may not make excessive noise after 11pm during finals or on school nights; on other nights  begins at 1am. Excessive noise is defined as any noise that can be heard from a member’s room which causes a disturbance.” 

“Quiet Hours are to be decided each semester during Fireside Chats and affirmed in that semester’s Community Agreements. Excessive noise is defined as any noise that can be heard from a member’s room which causes a disturbance.”  submitted by Cristian “CZ” Zamora 

Rationale: Quiet hours have long been dynamic, being set during the Fireside Chat/Community Agreement Process. This Amendment brings this Section of the Bylaws in alignment with current practice. I left the definition for excessive noise in there, but feel free to offer suggestions! 

Tavi presiding.

Leah - 3 a.m. people were screaming in the hallways, I'm lowkey anti quiet hours, but we don't yell at three a.m. Apparently we need that [reminder].

CZ - This gives us a little more power. What the current house population wants for the semester.

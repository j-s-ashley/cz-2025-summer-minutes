# Manager announcements

## CZ

A bunch of open positions. Now that we're closing in on fall, gonna plug these more. 

### list of empty positions

 - Adcom Representative
 - Board representative (position 2 of 2)

 - safe space and security (position 2 of 2)

fall
 - house
 - secretary
 - health
 - habitability
 - social (2 positions)
 - safe space and security (position 2 of 2)

Talk with Emmett, Nick about hab interest. Please run for social, important part of our house.

### VOCs

There are a couple concerns about responses that voted that the manager was performing poorly but not much actual feedback. Because we're so short [on time] the second VOCs are kind of a psuedo VOC process in that the form will still go out but the managers won't be required to respond.

Next week is the last week to submit motions that require two-week votes (bylaw amendments, expenditures over $200, png changes). Final council is the 10th of August. I don't think I'm ready for it to be the final, this has been a lot of fun.

## Nyanza - Unboxing

This package came to us from "Old Czar Alum" last week addressed to current Czars.

Records?

CZ - A gaper!!

Artist: Girl Scout

Producer: DadBod Records.

We have cleared the mail cabinets and have gotten to the bins. I don't know if I'll be able to do much more but hopefully the next mail manager will be able to continue this process.

## Vivi - PreFall Room bids

Please respond to inquiry about whether you're staying to the fall!

Also want to correct some info: There's about 30 new move ins, not as big as I anticipated. However, I will say we will be using triples and doubles as intended.

Q - Do you have an actual number?

A - Around 70.

CZ - I'll run down to CO tomorrow to get confirmation.

## Ella 

Tavi and I will be going out on Tuesday to pick up OtC meds, if you need any please let us know. This isn't stuff that we can do through the house budget for health. Comment on the health manager hub post, fill out the form, reach out to Ella or Tavi.

Please request stuff. Even if you don't use the stuff, someone else will!

## Jordan

There are two confessionz. Some chamoy-level spice. That's two more than last week.

# Nominations, Elections, and Installations

CZ - Ava running for Safe Space and Security for the remainder of summer and fall. Then I and Valentine are running for House Manager for Fall.

## Safe Space and Security

### Ava's Statement

I was a manager in my old house and it made living there a lot easier. Having that insider knowledge makes things easier for me. I don't want Nyanza to do this alone. A lot of my employment at the uni has been moving crowds. Idk if ya have ever worked downtown but there are a lot of people that need to be put in their place at the art studio and I'm very good at that. I also plan to figure out a way to monitor the chat so that it's safer and people feel more comfortable. I don't know about ya'll but I don't like to scroll and scroll looking for actual info and I don't like to block my housemates.

### Anon comments

**Member statement** - You guys know that I normally don't come to council. I'm nervous because this is something I've been going through for months. A few weeks into the semester I started getting targeted by Ava. Can be confirmed by others. She would interrupt conversations... be talking with someone else but focusing on with body language. I reached out to her to let her know that her her comments were hurtful and she said my brain was full of glitter and earthworms. [During workshift] it felt humiliating to watch her do little work ... during a time when vulnerable ... [I wrote a blog post] ...  But the ... the fact that you can't center yourself in that article. When I was hanging out with friends she would look at me and roll her eyes. She went to Katya and said that my personal blog was a personal attack into her. I want to directly quote here. "I admit that I had a knee jerk reaction, but it should't come as a surprise seeing as how I was trying to make you a friend..." Her interractions were limited to asking for a plate. She physically shoved me at the medicine cabinet and I asked her to say excuse me, she scoffed. Rae has noticed her behavior to me. She's not a safe person to reach out to as she has harmed me physically and emotionally.

**Q** - What are the responsibilities for the position? She's only running for safe space, right?

**A** - Yep. 

From the bylaws:

The Safe Space and Security Managers are specifically responsible for…
...doing their best to make sure all members feel safe, secure, and accepted in their home on a regular basis as well as during parties and special events.
...promoting Safe Space by working with other managers to organize, uphold, and enforce community agreements, standards, and expectations in order to create a congenial, comfortable, and cooperative living environment.
...working with social managers in setting and enforcing guest policy for each event, and ensuring the appropriate security personnel have access to the guest list.
...organizing security for the entire duration of all house parties, and during such events security personnel will be known as “The Law.”
...delegating members to educate guests on consent and house culture before and during house parties (aka consent talks).  This includes hosting a workshop educating house members on how to give consent talks, as well as making these materials available either via email and/or via bathroom flyers.
...delegating trained and trustworthy first responders to remove uncooperative guests and, if necessary, to respond appropriately to confrontations within the house.
...maintaining and posting throughout the house a list with the contact information of managers and first responders. 
...maintaining and regularly updating a list for weekend workshift.
...maintaining and passing on a Safe Space & Security Handbook. This handbook should be updated when appropriate to reflect the responsibilities and nature of the position.

We need to do a job description audit.

Never seen a handbook.

**Member statement** - As a member, I can see Ava doing well in the role. She says she has experience, which is really important for this job. I witnessed Ava having a boarderline medical emergency and still go through doing consent talks. Even when I did ICKY, there was this understanding about not liking each other, but even in that situation Ava was able to be cordial and still contribute to the team.

**Member statement** - Every conflict I've seen Ava handle has made me confident in how Ava would handle space. Ava has a good approach to deescalation. Even if everyone won't be friends with me at the end of the day we need to make sure everyone can live in the same house together. I'm fully confident Ava will do well as safe space manager.

**BANJO INTERLUDE A LA MARGAUX**

### Q&A

Q - As a safe space manager, when we have personal disagreements with others, do you think that you'll be able to put that aside if someone comes to you for help? 

A - I think that would be difficult and that's also why there are two of us, so I would be able to talk it out. There are some biases that we can't swallow, but that's when I would defer to the other manager or house manager/president, so I think that can be easily worked around.

Vivi - Do we have another manager for the fall?

Nyanza - *raises hand*

Ella - Comment - In the interactions Ava had, I've seen her say even when she doesn't agree with the other person that she understands where the person is coming from.

Q - CZ - Have you talked with Nyanza about working together in the fall?

A - We've talked a little, not really plans because of how people trickle in, but we've sat down and had in depth conversations and will talk more in the fall.

Q - Ella - A conflict from the spring was brought up in anon comments, in the interest of hearing both sides, is there anything you want to respond to? (Clarification - Margaux - There's an accusation of physical contact)

A - That's news to me. I may have bumped into her? She has pushed my buttons and I've definitely said things I'm not proud of. I might not have handled everything perfectly ... I'm genuinely uncomfortable around this person. This really fucks with my head. I'm not targeting her, or escalating this, I would like it to stop. It's just really weird. Really weird.

Q - Margaux - Can I ask what the nature of the conflict was?

A - She projected onto another house mate that I had liasons with. She started spreading rumors about my business ... she took some things I said and spun them into microagressions. Wrote a [blog] about how I was no better than a violent man. I don't know what's important here and what's not, it's just all really shitty. I feel like all of my dirty laundry is out now because of this whole thing.

There will be a ballot Monday or Tuesday.

## Valentine and CZ for house managers

### Valentine's Statement

Hi house, My name is Valentine and I'm running for house manager. I tend to keep to myself, but I'm someone who's very dedicated. I generally wnat to make everyone's experience moving in to be better than mine. I want new czars to be able to navigate the house. I geniuinely believe I'm able to fulfill all of the requirements and more. People's safety is always my first priority.

### CZ's Statement

I think I've had a solid run as president, with areas to improve such as responding to people. I think I got a little burnt out, but I'm excited to do things like house manager office hours. I've lived here since 2021 and have worked very closely with Vivi this summer so I already have idea of the list of duties. I'm really excited to learn more about the role. Seeing the different managers throughout the years has been exciting. Ther are so many signed trio signatures around the house and it's a really cool cult to be a part of. I think this is [Valentine's] first manager position but they are very keen on safey and we will compliment each other. I have a lot of stories of all kinds. In a couple weeks my anneverczary is coming up. I'm really excited and I hope you will vote me as house manager.

### Anon comments

**Member statement** - I think they're both going to be awesome at it.

**Member statement** - I'm very excited to see these people in house mangager positions. They're going to do a good job. They have the right qualities you want to see in a house manager. They both seem empathtic, diligient, want the best. 

**Member statement** - I've worked really closely with CZ for this whole semester and she's really helped me out when I needed it. She's always very involved in the house in a very empathetic way. I also feel very confident in her ability to continue seemlessly from summer to fall.

**Member statement** - I have concerns about how CZ said she hit burnout. However, I think that the transition could be made to look effortless with voting her in. Even with my concerns, I still think she's a perfect fit.

**Member statement** - Valentine and I moved in around the same time and I've seen her come out of her shell and I think she'd be able to do very well. She's very compassionate. Both of them together eases that newness factor because they can work together and hopefully do well.

### Q&A 

Ellla - Do you have any plans for mitigating burn out?

CZ - Office hours weekly will really help, the dedication. This semster I've been really proud about how on top of everything I've stayed. There've obviously been a couple things that have fallen through the cracks. I have a strategy that has worked well in the summer that will work well in the fall. Consistent daily schedule. I'm also just excited to have a partner, 'cause then you can say "hey can you take this today?"

Ella - Have you and Valentine talked about how you want to delegate responsbiilties or a plan?

CZ - We don't have a formal plan but we're going to talk with Vivi about a list of exact duties and delegate from there. We've had the inklings of conversations about things like that, but I'm super excited about them coming back and getting to work with them in person. And obviously with you, very excited to get that trio going.

Vivi - Are there any aspects of house that you are apprehensive about?

CZ - It's a lot of people. A lot of people work. A lot of people to people interractions. One of my VOC comments that I'lll be responding to, being harder to reach, will challenge me. A lot of people with very specific needs. Really relying on a partner to say "hey, where you at?" 

Vivi - Are there any aspects you are excited about?

CZ - I'm also really excited about the peope part. I'm excited to be the first person they connect with. If they're walkinging through the womb to get water, someone to say hi to. I've started being more friendly in general, saying hi to people on the street. I feel like House Manager is more like the house parent, and I'm excited to fill that role, you knokw? Making sure everyone has what they need to live a good life.

Jordan - Worst situation possible: you're dealing with stuff, Valentine is dealing with stuff and asked you for help. How would you handle it?

CZ - This is what the trio is for. Think of a Venn diagramm. I think that relying on Ella and Valentine, if two of us are tapped out; if all thre e of us are tapped out how do we handle that? Everyone has a lot of really cool skills. I hope that would never happen, but in that case, relying on that support system would be my answer.

Ella - I just want to say you've been really proactivate about stuff. How you have talked about areas you want to improve.

# Motions and Discussions

## Emergency motion - Espresso machine

Called by Jordan, seconded by David

Passed by acclaimation

## Discussion - House Expenditure - Afro House

TLDR - Only give this to Czars or give it to anyone who wants to do the work?

Option 1: Donate up to $700 from the Hab Account to fund 30 hours of paid workshift($22/hr) to help reopen Afro House 

VS 

Option 2: Authorize up to 30 hours of paid workshift from CZ’s hab account(~$700) to go to CZars who help out during the Afro House Work Dayssubmitted by Tavi 

Rationale 1: This money will be available for coopers from all houses who show up to the work days, and should only be used if the working group's paid workshift funding is used up. We can, if we'd like, ask to prioritize paying czars with this money.

Rationale 2: This option would have the money go only to people who live at CZ, but means that there will be less available for other co-opers who want to help out.

POI: ~$24,000 in the Hab Account as of Summer 2025

Originally a motion, changed to a discussion because she wanted to give time for her and Emmett to chat.

Nyanza - I lean toward making this only for czars since this is our money.

David - Also leaning to option 2.

Vivi - The hab budget resets? So I would lean toward making it available for anyone.

Tavi - I think we've only have 4-5 people from CZ, so if we want to get this work done I think it should go to anyone. For context, I asked the people running this if they had infinite money what they would need, so that's where this number is coming from.

Ella - I'm extremely in favor of this regardless of the form it takes. I would be more toward czars being prioritized, but it should go to anyone. This is in alignment with our values as a house. I don't think we're going to use up our hab budget. This is a good use of our funds. If the CO isn't going to pay for this, this is a good thing to put our money towards. Especially since the only way this money is going to get touched is if the working group uses their current budget. This may also be something to reach out to other houses about, like "This is what CZ is doing, can you calso donate a small amount"

Tavi - Us literally putting our money where our mouths are.

Vivi - Are there other houses interested in sharing the burden?

Tavi - I haven't talked to other houses about it. I can. Ridge and Rochdale tend to lean CZwards. I can talk to others. I think it would be cool.

Ella - If we want to share this idea with other coops, one hour of workshift per four members of their coop, or per four of their max occupancy. This gives them a number to start with.

Tavi - I think if we're talking fundraising from other coops, paid workshifts is a start but what about all of us putting a little of our furniture budget? I don't think paid workshift should be our only focus. Getting off topic, but we can set up a group chat.

CZ - Leaning towards giving it to everyone.

## Motion 10.1 - Espresso machine and grinder

Motion to purchase an espresso machine and espresso bean grinder for $1800 and $600, respectively, from the Appliances Budget submitted by Donnell Wright 

Rationale: The people have spoken and I have caved - Donnell Wright; 

POI: ~$14,000 in Appliance Budget(we believe)

Q - Jordan - What kind of warranty does this thing have?

A - Covered by a limited warranty starting day of purchase. As long as we break it within that first year. Defect in the warranty period, at our sole discression we will repair or replace.. mumbling.. [I think he sent me a link and I lost it.]

Q - Vivi - Does the budget reset in summer or fall?

A - Summer is when furniture resets? It replenishes every two years, but we always get money as long as we spend it. It will be replenished at the beginning of the next fiscal year.

Q - David - How much did we spend on the hot water dispenser?

A - The budget was was $14000 at the beginning of the summer, take off $750 for the water dispenser.

Q - Are the furniture and appliance budgets two separate budgets?

A - No, they are the same budget.

Q - Nyanaza - I know one of the big questions has been maintenance, is there a plan for that?

A - Anyone who wants to use the machine has to learn how to use the machine. If you see someone who does not know how to use the machine, take their stuff away. I would rather you be rude to someone than let them fuck up a $2k machine. When I spoke to one of the cams on the discord, you only need to descale it once a week, so probably an IKC thing. I also want to tlak with workshift about doing a daily cleanout. That way more people know how to clean it than use it. That's the goal.

Q - Since we're talking about people needing to know how to use it, will we require people to clean it after they use it?

A - Absolutely, that's the goal.

Tavi - Comment - I will literally vote yes on whatever Donnell wants for the kitchen.

CZ - Something that came up during community agrements is updating all the signage, so maybe that can be a kitchen or maybe a hab question.

A - I want to get with Michael to get QR codes for instructions and manuals
